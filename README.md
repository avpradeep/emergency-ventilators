## Emergency Ventilators
---
This repository is intended to document at one place, various emergency-ventilator designs shared by acamedicians and engineers, all over the world, in the time of global crisis, COVID-19. 

A [website](https://waghaditya.github.io/emergency-ventilators/index.html), hosted from the repository, is used to post micro-blogs describing makers's efforts from the globe to build emergency-ventilatos.

The repository also stores designes, contributed from our collaborators, and documents the technical information on our [wiki](https://github.com/waghaditya/emergency-ventilators/wiki).
